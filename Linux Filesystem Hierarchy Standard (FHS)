# Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

Unlike Windows, which uses drive letters such as `C:\` and `D:\`, Linux uses a single directory tree that starts at the root directory `/`.  
This layout is defined by the **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)** to ensure consistency across Linux systems.

## Common Linux Directories

| Directory | Description | Example Contents |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| `/` (Root) | The starting point of the filesystem hierarchy. | Entire system |
| `/bin` | Essential user command binaries. | `ls`, `cp`, `cat`, `bash` |
| `/boot` | Files required to boot the system. | `vmlinuz` (kernel), `initrd`, GRUB |
| `/dev` | Device files representing hardware. | `/dev/sda` (disk), `/dev/tty` |
| `/etc` | System-wide configuration files. | `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` |
| `/home` | Users’ home directories. | `/home/john`, `/home/ali` |
| `/lib` | Shared libraries and kernel modules. | `libc.so`, kernel modules |
| `/mnt` | Temporary mount points. | Mounted disks |
| `/media` | Automatically mounted removable media. | `/media/usb-disk` |
| `/opt` | Optional third‑party software. | Google Chrome, TeamViewer |
| `/proc` | Virtual filesystem providing system information. | `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo` |
| `/root` | Home directory for the root user. | Root’s private files |
| `/sbin` | Essential system administration commands. | `iptables`, `fdisk`, `reboot` |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files. | Application caches |
| `/usr` | Secondary hierarchy for user applications and data. | `/usr/bin/python`, `/usr/share` |
| `/var` | Variable data that changes frequently. | `/var/log`, `/var/www` |

## Notes
- Everything in Linux is treated as a file, including devices.
- The FHS helps maintain consistency across distributions.
- Understanding this structure is essential for system administration and troubleshooting.
